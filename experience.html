<li> I used to work full time at a tea house called Chatime in E-Curve, Mutiara Damansara after finishing SPM. I work because I feel bored stayed at home doing nothing other than
 I want to earn my own money to continue studying. I worked there for six months before quitting because I had received an offer to continue studying at UiTM Kedah. The very friendly 
and welcoming co -workers made me feel comfortable and happy working there. I went to work by bus.

<li>I also used to work part -time at a sushi restaurant called Sushi King during the fourth semester break. I worked at the Setapak Central outlet, Kuala Lumpur and worked there for 
only a month. I worked because I wanted to earn my own money to continue the next semester. What’s interesting is that, if the sushi isn’t sold out, employees can spend it to avoid wastage.
